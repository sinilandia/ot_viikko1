# Software Requirements Specification: Pokemon Go raid counter aka Did I Raid That?

## Purpose

With this software, the users can keep tab on the Pokemon Go Raids and find out which raids they've attended and if they're eligible for EX Raid invitations.

> *Pokemon Go Raids are organized multiple times per day, when players gather together to fight the raid boss at the same time, at the same physical location called a Gym. Players get 1 raid pass/day. Raids show up in the game approximately 1 hour before the raid starts.

EX Raids are special raids organized once / 2 weeks / gym. EX raids are only organized at special, EX Raid gyms. Players can get an EX Raid invitation when s/he has previously won a regular raid at that gym. Invitations are sent approximately one week before the EX Raid. Player can invite one friend to an EX Raid.

There is no open API for Pokemon Go Raids. Therefore, users need to add this information manually.*
