| 21.3. | 3    | Reading through the material and exploring possible topics. Researching how and where to get weather API, how to build a Telegram bot, etc. |
| 24.3. | 1.5  | [Software requirements specification documentation](https://github.com/sinilandia/ot_viikko1/blob/master/documentation/srs.md) Wrote SRS. |
| 30.3  | 4.5  | Initial code for keeping tabs on raids and some tests |
| 4.3.  | 1    | Trying to (again) troubleshoot my double folder problem: DidIRaidThat and Didiraidthat. The first one includes only pom.xml and the latter all the code. When course perssonel clones my repo, they get both folders. When I clone my repo, I only get one. I don't know how to get rid of the other folder. Will troubleshoot at paja later this week. |
